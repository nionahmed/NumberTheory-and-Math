///Divisibility by 2 or 5

///for 2 last number must even for 5 last digit must 0 or 5 for both last digit must 0
///Divisibility by 3 or 9
///sum of digit must divisible by 3 /9

///Divisibility by 4
///last 2 digit divisible by 4

///Divisibility by 6
///last digit should even and digit sum must divisible by 3


///Divisibility by 11
///let 654321=1-2+3-4+5-6 = -3, not divisible by 11. so 654321 is not divisible by 11
